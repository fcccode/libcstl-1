This is a lib for C users that would like to get the convinient
of C++, mainly containing the STL-like data structure and algo_
rithm.

cstl directory contains the header files. The files that begin
with "c" is only convinient for user to include in the project.
For example, you can use vector by including cvector instead of
including cstl_vector.h, cstl_vector_private.h and cstl_vector_
iterator.h and more.
